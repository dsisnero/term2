# Comprehensive Bubble Tea Library Research and Porting Strategy

## Steps

1. **Phase 1: Deep Dive into Bubble Tea Core Architecture**
2. - Study Bubble Tea GitHub repository: main repo structure, README, documentation
3. - Analyze the Elm architecture pattern implementation: Model, Update, View, Command, Message
4. - Examine tea.Program structure: initialization, event loop, message passing
5. - Research terminal I/O handling: ANSI escape sequences, terminal capabilities detection
6. - Study the update cycle: message processing, state transitions, command execution
7. - Analyze error handling patterns and recovery mechanisms
8. - Research testing strategies and test utilities
   9.
9. **Phase 2: Ecosystem and Dependencies Analysis**
10. - Map all Bubble Tea dependencies: bubble, lipgloss, chroma, termenv
11. - Study Bubbles component library: available components, extension patterns
12. - Analyze Lip Gloss styling system: color handling, layout, borders, styling primitives
13. - Research Chroma terminal color library: color detection, fallback strategies
14. - Examine Termenv terminal environment detection
15. - Study any external dependencies and their specific roles

   17.

1. **Phase 3: Go Language Features Analysis**
2. - Map Go-specific features used: goroutines, channels, interfaces, struct embedding
3. - Analyze concurrency patterns: message passing, event handling, async operations
4. - Study error handling idioms and panic recovery
5. - Research reflection usage and type assertions
6. - Examine package organization and dependency management

   24.

7. **Phase 4: Crystal Language Compatibility Assessment**
8. - Research existing Crystal terminal libraries: cray, termbox-crystal, ncurses bindings
9. - Map Go features to Crystal equivalents: fibers vs goroutines, channels vs CML channels
10. - Analyze type system differences: interfaces vs modules, struct embedding vs inheritance
11. - Study Crystal's concurrency model and how it applies to terminal applications
12. - Research Crystal's exception handling and error management
13. - Identify potential challenges in porting Go idioms

   32.

1. **Phase 5: CML Integration Deep Analysis**
2. - Study CML documentation: channels, processes, select statements
3. - Design message passing architecture using CML primitives
4. - Plan fiber-based concurrency model for terminal event handling
5. - Research CML patterns for state management and event coordination
6. - Design integration between CML and terminal I/O operations
7. - Analyze performance characteristics and potential bottlenecks

   40.

8. **Phase 6: API Design and Architecture Planning**
9. - Design Crystal API that mirrors Bubble Tea functionality
10. - Plan type-safe interfaces for models, messages, and commands
11. - Design the core Program class and its lifecycle methods
12. - Plan component system architecture
13. - Design styling system equivalent to Lip Gloss
14. - Plan error handling and exception management strategy

   48.

15. **Phase 7: Implementation Strategy and Roadmap**
16. - Create proof-of-concept minimal terminal application
17. - Implement core Program class with basic event loop
18. - Port essential components: text input, spinner, progress bar
19. - Implement styling system with color and layout support
20. - Create comprehensive test suite with terminal simulation
21. - Plan incremental development approach

   56.

22. **Phase 8: Performance and Optimization Research**
23. - Benchmark performance against original Go implementation
24. - Analyze rendering performance and optimization opportunities
25. - Study memory usage patterns and garbage collection impact
26. - Research cross-platform compatibility considerations
27. - Test different terminal environments and capabilities

   63.

28. **Phase 9: Documentation and Community Strategy**
29. - Create comprehensive API documentation
30. - Build example applications demonstrating various use cases
31. - Create migration guide from Bubble Tea to Crystal version
32. - Document best practices and common patterns
33. - Plan community engagement and contribution guidelines
