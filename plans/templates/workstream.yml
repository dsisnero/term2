# Workstream Definition Template
# This template defines the structure for machine-readable workstream plans

# Basic workstream metadata
workstream:
  id: "workstream-id"                    # Unique identifier (e.g., "interactive-config")
  title: "Workstream Title"              # Human-readable title
  letter: "A"                            # Workstream letter for reference
  status: "active"                       # active, completed, queued, blocked
  priority: 1                            # Priority level (1=highest)
  created_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"     # Creation timestamp
  updated_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"     # Last update timestamp

# Agent assignment and coordination
assignment:
  assigned_agent: "agent-id"             # Agent responsible for this workstream
  agent_type: "specialist"               # specialist, generalist, orchestrator
  required_skills: []                    # Required skills for this workstream
  estimated_completion: "2024-01-15"     # Estimated completion date

# Dependencies and relationships
dependencies:
  blocks: []                             # Workstreams this workstream blocks
  blocked_by: []                         # Workstreams blocking this one
  depends_on: []                         # Workstreams this depends on
  related_to: []                         # Related workstreams

# Requirements and constraints
requirements:
  - "crystal_spec_passing"               # System requirements
  - "stdin_handling_fixed"
  acceptance_criteria:                    # Acceptance criteria
    - "All existing tools work with auto-generated schemas"
    - "Schema validation catches malformed inputs"

# Task breakdown with progress tracking
tasks:
