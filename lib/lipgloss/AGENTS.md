# Agent Instructions

This is a port of golang lipgloss. The golang code is the source of truth. Any tests output must match the golang test output.  Any logic must match the golang src logic.

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```
**DO NOT use internal todo list or task list tools** - Use beads for all issue tracking and work management:


## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
   * **Crystal-specific quality gates**:

      ```bash
      crystal tool format
      ameba --fix
      ameba
      crystal spec

    ```text

    * **other gates**
      - rumdl format

      Ensure no formatting issues remain, all ameba errors are fixed, and all tests pass before committing.
3. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
4. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
5. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
6. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
7. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
8. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
