# Barrier Example
# ===============
# A barrier is a synchronization primitive where a group of fibers
# wait until all enrolled fibers have reached the barrier point.
# When all fibers arrive, an update function is applied to the shared state
# and all fibers are released.

puts "Demonstrating how multiple fibers synchronize at a barrier point"

# Create a counting barrier that increments its state each round
barrier = CML.counting_barrier(0)

# Create 3 enrollments in the barrier

  enrollments << barrier.enroll

# Spawn 3 fibers that will synchronize at the barrier
